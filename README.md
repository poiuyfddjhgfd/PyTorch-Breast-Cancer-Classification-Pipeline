# PyTorch Breast Cancer Classification Pipeline
This repository contains a complete PyTorch training pipeline for binary classification of breast cancer diagnosis using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset.

📋 Project Overview
The notebook implements a logistic regression model from scratch using PyTorch to classify breast tumors as malignant (M) or benign (B) based on various features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.
